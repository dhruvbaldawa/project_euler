Problem 46

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite
number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9  = 7  + 2x1^2
15 = 7  + 2x2^2
21 = 3  + 2x3^2
25 = 7  + 2x3^2
27 = 19 + 2x2^2
33 = 31 + 2x1^2

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as
the sum of a prime and twice a square?
